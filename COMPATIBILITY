            == MCI: Managed Compiler Infrastructure ==

                -- Compatibility --

The MCI generally requires version 2.0 of the D language.

The following compilers are supported:

    * Digital Mars D (DMD)
    * GNU D Compiler (GDC)
    * LLVM D Compiler (LDC)
    * Stupid D Compiler (SDC)

The MCI will generally compile even if you're using an unsupported
compiler, but we cannot in any way guarantee support.

The following architectures are supported:

    * x86 (32-bit and 64-bit)
    * ARM (32-bit)
    * PowerPC (32-bit and 64-bit)
    * Itanium (64-bit)
    * MIPS (32-bit and 64-bit)

Architecture must be determinable when compiling, or the compilation
process will be aborted.

The following operating systems are supported:

    * Windows
    * Linux
    * Mac OS X
    * FreeBSD
    * OpenBSD
    * Solaris
    * AIX
    * Hurd

Operating system must be determinable when compiling, or the compilation
process will be aborted.

The following emulation layers can optionally be used:

    * Cygwin
    * MinGW

Byte order must also be determined when compiling.
