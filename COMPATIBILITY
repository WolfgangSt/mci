            == MCI: Managed Compiler Infrastructure ==

                -- Compatibility --

The MCI generally requires version 2.0 of the D language.

The following compilers are supported:

    * Digital Mars D (DMD)
    * GNU D Compiler (GDC)
    * LLVM D Compiler (LDC)
    * Stupid D Compiler (SDC)

The MCI will probably compile even if you're using an unsupported
compiler, but we cannot in any way guarantee support.

The following architectures are supported:

    * x86 (32-bit and 64-bit)
    * ARM (32-bit)
    * PowerPC (32-bit and 64-bit)
    * Itanium (64-bit)
    * MIPS (32-bit and 64-bit)

Architecture must be determinable when compiling, or the compilation
process will be aborted.

The following operating systems are supported:

    * Windows
    * Linux
    * Mac OS X
    * FreeBSD
    * OpenBSD
    * Solaris
    * AIX
    * Hurd

Operating system must be determinable when compiling, or the compilation
process will be aborted.

The following emulation layers can optionally be used:

    * Cygwin
    * MinGW

Byte order must also be determined when compiling.

The MCI also depends on the libffi library with full support for the
closure API. As far as we are aware, this configuration is available
across all combinations of supported architectures and operating systems.
