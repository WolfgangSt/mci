            == MCI: Managed Compiler Infrastructure ==

                -- Compatibility --

The MCI generally requires D 2.0.

The following compilers are supported:

    * Digital Mars D (DMD)
    * GNU D Compiler (GDC)
    * LLVM D Compiler (LDC)
    * Stupid D Compiler (SDC)

The MCI will generally compile even if you're using an unsupported
compiler, but we cannot in any way guarantee support.

The following architectures are supported:

    * x86 (32-bit and 64-bit)
    * ARM (32-bit)
    * PowerPC (32-bit and 64-bit)
    * Itanium (64-bit)
    * MIPS (32-bit and 64-bit)
    * System/390 (32-bit and 64-bit)

Architecture must be determined when compiling, or the compilation
process will be aborted.

The following operating systems are supported:

    * Windows
    * Linux
    * Mac OS X
    * FreeBSD
    * OpenBSD
    * Solaris
    * AIX
    * Hurd

Operating system must be determined when compiling, or the compilation
process will be aborted.

The following emulation layers can be used:

    * Cygwin
    * MinGW

Byte order must also be determined when compiling.

During compilation (when config.d is compiled), a configuration briefing
will be printed. This is useful for determining the cause of problems in the
compilation process. If a configuration issue is found, the compilation
process will generally abort in config.d.
