            == MCI: Managed Compiler Infrastructure ==

                -- Compatibility --

The MCI generally requires D 2.0, but allows compilation to happen in
version 1.0 of the language. The latter is, however, unsupported.

The following compilers are supported:

    * Digital Mars D (DMD)
    * GNU D Compiler (GDC)
    * LLVM D Compiler (LDC)

The MCI will generally compile even if you're using an unsupported
compiler, but we cannot in any way guarantee support.

The following architectures are supported:

    * x86
    * x86-64

Architecture must be determined when compiling, or the compilation
process will be aborted.

The following forms of inline assembly are supported:

    * x86
    * x86-64

Inline assembly is not required, but if no assembler is available, no
low-level optimizations in the MCI will be enabled.

The following operating systems are supported:

    * Windows
    * FreeBSD
    * Solaris
    * Mac OS X
    * Linux

Operating system must be determined when compiling, or the compilation
process will be aborted.

Byte order must also be determined when compiling.

During compilation (when config.d is compiled), a configuration briefing
will be printed. This is useful for determining the cause of problems in the
compilation process. If a configuration issue is found, the compilation
process will generally abort in config.d.
