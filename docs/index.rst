Welcome to the MCI
==================

The MCI (Managed Compiler Infrastructure) is a modern and intuitive back end
for compilers, runtimes, code analyzers, and other developer tools.

This is the infrastructure guide. It provides a high-level view of the
features, architecture, and design of the MCI. It is intended to give the
reader an overview of how the back end and virtual machine work. It is also
a good reference for writing programs to run under the MCI's execution engines
(the JIT/AOT compilers and the interpreter) and for the various command line
tools that the MCI provides.
