Intrinsics
==========

The MCI defines a number of built-in functions that can be called by any
program compiled with the infrastructure. These all reside in the ``mci``
module, which is actually implemented in D code inside the ``mci.vm``
library.

This module is given special treatment by the assembler, so you do not
have to reference it on the command line.
