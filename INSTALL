                -- Installation --

Installation on Linux works through a single Makefile:

    $ make

If you have a working compiler installed, this should just work.

There are some variables that you can override when building with
the Makefile:

    * MODEL (= 64)
      - Which pointer size to build for (32 or 64).
    * BUILD (= debug)
      - The build mode (debug, release, or test). The test mode will
        run the unit test suite after the build completes.
    * DPLC (= dmd)
      - The compiler to be used. See the COMPATIBILITY file for a
        list of supported compilers.

For example, to do a 32-bit release build:

    $ make BUILD=release MODEL=32

The resulting libraries and executables will be placed in the root
directory of the source distribution.

Building on Windows is only supported via Visual D. Simply install
your compiler of choice, configure Visual D to use it, and compile
MCI.sln with the desired configuration.

Note that the MCI cannot currently be compiled for 64-bit on Windows
with DMD, due to limitations in Optlink (among other things). It is
not a limitation in the MCI itself.
