            == MCI: Managed Compiler Infrastructure ==

                -- Introduction --

Welcome to the MCI!

The MCI (Managed Compiler Infrastructure) is a project that seeks to
write a complete compiler infrastructure and JIT (just-in-time) compiler
in the D 2.0 language.

The rationale for such a project is that developing and maintaining such
systems in C/C++ (or similar languages) is tedious and error-prone. Also,
such native implementations usually cannot expose a clean object-oriented
API.

In addition, the MCI puts high emphasis on treating code as data. Code is
generally represented in its original form, and the object model is fully
extensible for new languages.
