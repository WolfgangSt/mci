                -- Introduction --

Welcome to the MCI!

The MCI (Managed Compiler Infrastructure) is a project that seeks to
write a complete compiler infrastructure and JIT (just-in-time) compiler
in the D language (version 2.0). The goal is a modern, intuitive, and
future-proof API usable by as many front ends as possible.

The rationale for such a project is that developing and maintaining such
systems in C/C++ (or similar languages) is tedious and error-prone. Other
languages also don't offer the possibility to expose a clean and simple
API, particularly due to the lack of a garbage collector and an exhaustive
standard library.

The MCI puts emphasis on treating code as data. A tree model is used as
the primary point of entry into the MCI, rather than an assembly-like
intermediate representation. This makes it easy to transform parsed source
code into MCI data structures. Additionally, the tree model is fully
extensible for new languages.
